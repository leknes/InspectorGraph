# InspectorGraph
Extends Unity with the inspector graph, an editor window in which components can be edited like in the inspector, but in a graph view with ports representing component references and support for interface serialization.

## TODO

* I should put all the code into an assembly definition.
* There is a minor issue, that when adding multiple components they first are stacked on each other.
* Minor error when adding components? (You cannot call GetLast immediately after beginning a group.)
